- 👋 Hi, I’m Luca (@luca-eidos)
- 👀 I’m interested in many programming languages (mainly Java, Javascript, Python and C). 
- 👌 I like developing for Windows, Linux, Android and embedded devices (like STM32, Arduino and Raspberry Pi).
- ❤️ I love Web Development. My favourite technologies are React/Next and Firebase.
- 💻 I'm currently working on an embedded project on STM32 microcontrollers and a web application based on Next and MongoDB. 
- ❌ Not a big fan of Apple, but I have some experience on MacOS.
